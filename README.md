# CS50W
## Project 0 

[Live](https://github.com/ElineJ)

For project 0 I decided to make a personal website to showcase what I'm doing during my #100DaysOfCode challenge. It contains a homepage with navigation to three other pages: about, projects and links.

## Files

File           | Description
-------------  | -------------
index.html     | The homepage, includes a navigation bar (bootstrap component) that is mobile friendly 
about.html     | About page, styled using Bootstrap's grid model and contains two `<ul>`'s
projects.html  | Overview of projects I've made, with images and Bootstrap badges
links.html     | Page with different links and resources, sorted in an `<ul>` and a table
styles.scss    | The main scss file that's compiled into CSS, includes imports to seperate Sass files (divided for clarity)
_home.scss     | All CSS for the index.html page (homepage)
_about.scss    | All CSS for the about.html page
_projects.scss | All CSS for the projects.html
_links.scss    | All CSS for the links.html page
